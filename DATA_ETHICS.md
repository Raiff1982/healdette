# Data & Ethics

## Ancestry-Aware Modeling
This software implements ancestry-aware antibody design, considering genetic and immunological variations across different populations. The model:
- Incorporates HLA type matching (currently supporting 2 matches)
- Considers ancestry-specific immune responses
- Adapts to metabolic variations

## Ethics and Oversight
- All sequences are logged with ancestry context
- Ethical validation performed via CoreConscience system
- Full traceability of design decisions
- Rejection memory maintains record of discarded designs

## Ethics Statement
This software is designed to promote inclusive and ethical antibody development. We are committed to preventing misuse and ensuring equitable benefit across populations.
